# What is Baseline?

Web Platform Baseline gives you clear information about which web platform features are ready to use in your projects today. When reading an article, or choosing a library for your project, if the features used are all part of Baseline, you can trust the level of browser compatibility. By aligning with Baseline, there should be no surprises when testing your site.

## How do features become part of Baseline?

Features that are in Baseline are interoperable across a core browser set:

- Chrome (desktop and Android)
- Edge
- Firefox (desktop and Android)
- Safari (macOS and iOS)

Baseline has two stages:

- **Newly available**: The feature becomes supported by all of the core browsers, and is therefore interoperable. Indicated with a blue icon.
- **Widely available**: 30 months has passed since the newly interoperable date. The feature can be used by most sites without worrying about support. Indicated with a green icon.

Features that are newly available can be used with confidence that they work in all the core browsers, however most people will need to consider fallbacks for browsers without support.

Features that are widely available should be considered broadly available for use.

## How do I find the Baseline status of a feature?

Baseline is already displayed for many features on [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), and all features on [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev) so you can see at a glance the status of features. We hope that many other sites will start to use Baseline to clearly explain feature statusâ€”from individual blogs to large content sites. Find out how to [use Baseline on your site](use-baseline) and explore some of the places you can already [find Baseline](baseline-in-the-wild).

## Who owns Baseline?

The Baseline definition and the feature grouping work that decides if features are part of Baseline is owned by the [Web Features Owners Group](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) and discussed in the [WebDX Community Group](webdx-cg).
