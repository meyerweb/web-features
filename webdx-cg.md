# The WebDX Community Group

> The mission of the [Web Developer Experience (WebDX) Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) is to facilitate coordinated approaches to improve the overall experience of developing for the Web platform when such coordination provides unique opportunities for these improvements. â€” [WebDX Community Group charter](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/admin/blob/main/charter.md).

A subset of the members of the CG make up the owner and governance body for Baseline. The official definition of what Baseline is, including the goals and non-goals of the project, can be found in the [web-platform-dx/web-features repository](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/docs/baseline.md).

The community group also owns the [web feature grouping work](web-features).

## Get involved

As a W3C community group, anyone can become involved in the work of the WebDX Community Group, by [joining through the W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/join). This is how to take a more active role in Baseline, or in other web developer experience initiatives. If you work for a company that is a W3C member, your membership needs to be approved by your representative, otherwise you can join as an individual.
